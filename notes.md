Treehouse python learning path: Code Challenges, Projects, and Notes


Methods - functions inside of classes. They take self as an argument.
Calling a method - instance_name.my_method()
Passing in values - instance_name.my_method(‘some value’)
Calling a method inside of another - use self.my_method() instead of instance_name.my_method() (since self essentially equals instance_name)
Using an attribute - self.my_attribute when inside of your class
