Lexicographical ordering is very similar to alphabetical ordering, but it considers additional characters besides the letters of the alphabet.

Some of the basic rules in Python are that:

1) Uppercase letters come earlier than lowercase letters. This means that A < Z < a < z.

2) Numbers come earlier than letters. This means that 0 < 9 < A < a.

3) Space characters come before all printable characters.
